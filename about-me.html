                By the end of my studies, I decided that psychology is not what
                I want to do for a living. While I don't have a new precise
                plan yet, I began working in an administrative position for a
                large corporation. After some time, I joined an IT company,
                still as an administrative worker where I had the opportunity
                to see what it's like to work in this industry. I was responsible
                for managing the company's second-largest office, located in
                Warsaw. My work was appreciated, and I was soon promoted to the
                position of assistant to the company's CEO and management board.
                This gave me an excellent opportunity to closely observe how
                they run the business. I had the chance to cooperate with almost
                every department. However, there wouldn't be a web development
                company without developers. I became curious about programming
                and wanted to try it. So I did, and it just clicked! It's
                fascinating how something that initially appeared like a Sci-Fi
                code from <i>the Matrix</i> is now making sense. That's so
                satisfying to build something from scratch that was previously
                a mysterious black box. It's surprising how much pride and joy
                something as simple as fetching data from an API or creating a
                registration form can bring. So, I decided to change my career.
                I left my previous job to fully dedicate myself to learning
                programming and eventually became a frontend developer. With
                some help from my experienced programmer friends, I am studying
                documentations, taking courses, learning from tutorials, and
                finally, making some pet projects to practice the knowledge gained.
                I can't wait to get my first commercial experience as a developer.
